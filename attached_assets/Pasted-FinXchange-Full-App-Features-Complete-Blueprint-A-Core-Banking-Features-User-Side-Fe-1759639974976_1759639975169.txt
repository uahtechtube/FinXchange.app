Given the scope, I need to inform you of some important constraints:Key Limitations:1.No Backend Infrastructure: I cannot create a separate backend server. All "backend" logic must run client-side or use external APIs.2.Squad API Integration: You'll need Squad API credentials (sandbox or live) to enable the virtual account creation, payments, and transfers.3.No Real KYC/BVN Verification: I can build the UI and storage, but actual BVN/NIN verification requires backend infrastructure and regulatory approval.4.USSD Feature: True USSD integration requires telecom partnerships - I can only simulate this within the app.5.Admin Dashboard: Would need a separate web/admin interface.Realistic MVP Approach:I'll build a fully functional client-side fintech app with:‚Ä¢‚úÖ Complete user authentication & profile management‚Ä¢‚úÖ Wallet system with transaction history‚Ä¢‚úÖ Internal user-to-user transfers (instant)‚Ä¢‚úÖ Airtime/data/bills payments (mockable until you add Squad API)‚Ä¢‚úÖ AI voice banking assistant‚Ä¢‚úÖ Security features (PIN, biometrics)‚Ä¢‚úÖ Savings goals & financial management‚Ä¢‚úÖ Beautiful iOS-optimized UII'll structure it so you can easily plug in Squad API later for real banking features.Should I proceed with building this MVP? I'll start with:1.Authentication & onboarding flow2.Main dashboard with wallet3.Core transaction features4.AI assistant integrationLet me know if you want me to start, or if you'd like to adjust the scope!Saved project updates2 filesYOUWhat about voice paymentAcquired sandboxWorkedExcellent question! Voice Payment is definitely included - it's one of the most innovative features of FinXchange. Let me clarify what I'll build:üéôÔ∏è Voice Payment Features I'll Implement:1. Voice Commands for Transactions‚Ä¢"Send 5000 naira to John"‚Ä¢"Pay my electricity bill"‚Ä¢"Buy 1000 naira airtime"‚Ä¢"Check my balance"‚Ä¢"Transfer 2000 to account number 1234567890"2. Voice PIN Authentication‚Ä¢User can set up voice biometric authentication‚Ä¢Speak a PIN phrase for secure transactions‚Ä¢Fallback to numeric PIN if needed3. Voice-Activated Banking Assistant‚Ä¢Natural conversation: "How much did I spend on data this month?"‚Ä¢Transaction confirmation via voice‚Ä¢Voice feedback for all operations4. Technical Implementation:‚Ä¢Speech-to-Text: Using OpenAI Whisper API (already available via transcribe-audio.ts)‚Ä¢AI Processing: OpenAI GPT-4 to understand intent and execute commands‚Ä¢Text-to-Speech: expo-speech for voice responses‚Ä¢Voice Recording: expo-av for capturing user voice commands5. Voice Payment Flow:User: "Send 5000 naira to John Doe"‚ÜìApp: "I found John Doe in your contacts. Send ‚Ç¶5,000 to John Doe?"‚ÜìUser: "Yes, confirm"‚ÜìApp: "Please say your voice PIN or enter your 4-digit PIN"‚ÜìUser: [Authenticates]‚ÜìApp: "Transaction successful. ‚Ç¶5,000 sent to John Doe"This will be a standout feature!
